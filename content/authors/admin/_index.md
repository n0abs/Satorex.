I was studying computer science when a terrible thing happened to my family. My grandfather had clicked on an advertisement on the Internet. He was called for months by a personal advisor. This advisor supposedly invested my grandpa's money. In reality, my grandpa was scammed, he lost €74,000 and had signed a loan of more than €32,000. Back then, I asked friends from my football club how to find these fraudsters or what we could do. My friends and I were surprised when we realised how big the scam industry is. Together we decided to fight against this industry.
