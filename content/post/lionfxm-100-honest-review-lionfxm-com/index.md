## Who is LionFXM?

**LionFXM** is an internet based investment firm and offers trading in the CFD/Forex market. CFD means “Contract for difference” and is a contract between provider and user. With **LionFXM**, the user is made to believe that he is trading on the financial market on the domain: **lionfxm.com**. One can assume that the reality is quite different. The website was set up exclusively to deceive people.

We have checked various regulators and could not find any licence. The company that is supposed to be behind **LionFXM** is called **AXA Business Solution Ltd**, this statement may be questioned.

We assume that this provider is unregulated. Unregulated is not always a bad thing, but more red flags appeared during our check. Most clients – perhaps including you – end up with this provider via one of the various **[“auto trading software”](https://satorex.com/auto-trading-software/)**. In any case, this software is non-existent.

## How does it work?

Unregulated forex brokers like **LionFXM** usually work in the following way. The client signs up via a questionable advertisement and is then called by an employee of this company. The employee raves about the earning potential, what other traders have already achieved and how easy everything is with a personal account manager.

The customer only has to deposit a small sum and perhaps account models with very special benefits will be sold. **Don’t fall for it.** Then you will have your personal account manager constantly selling you opportunities to deposit more and more. *This is justified with risk diversification, the once-in-a-lifetime chance to participate in a special event or the higher returns.*

## Your deposit with this provider

As a rule, no bank works with such providers at all. The scammers sometimes open accounts under false pretences, but that never works in the long run.

That’s why you must always turn to crypto exchanges, because cryptocurrencies are easy to acquire, harder to track and know no borders. Perhaps you have had the experience of one of the agents connecting to Teamviewer or Anydesk and registering you with a crypto exchange. Now you are beginning to understand why it is all so complicated.

## Withdrawal of funds

Providers like **LionFXM** usually do not pay out the money again. You have to exploit a weakness of your personal account manager. These employees are paid from the deposit. Discuss a test withdrawal with your personal account manager so that you dare to make a larger deposit. Try 50% of your own deposit. Don’t be stupid! Do it yourself and not with Anydesk or Teamviewer. Either your adviser will cheat you or you will cheat him. There is no other truth.

## Can I charge back my payment?

It depends on the details. Sometimes there is the possibility to get the money back via Visa, Mastercard or other means of payment. The time component is important.

Did you make the payment today or recently? Read the next points. Did you make the payment a long time ago? Then you can only turn to the authorities, I have also made a separate point for this.

## Chargeback of payments with credit card

If you made your payment recently, chances are you will get your money back. Check your bank statement to see which company charged your credit card. Google that company.

If it was a crypto exchange, you have no chance. This company delivered the cryptocurrency to you and you delivered the cryptocurrency to your *advisor*. For all other companies, go directly to the bank from which you received the credit card. Open a dispute and request a chargeback.

## Chargeback of payments with bank transfer

If you made the payment today or yesterday, call the bank IMMEDIATELY. The bank can recall transfers. Some banks claim they can’t, but that’s nonsense. Put pressure on them.

Then go to **[IBANCalculator](https://www.ibancalculator.com/)** and enter the IBAN of the recipient. This page will show you the recipient’s bank. Call the recipient’s bank and explain that this person is working with a fake investment company called **LionFXM**, which is not regulated, and that you have been tricked into transferring money with lies.

If the bank is in another country, you can use Google Translate and send a very detailed email. You can find the contact information on the bank’s page.

If the transfer happened a long time ago, the bank cannot do anything. Write an email to your bank to block the IBAN of the recipient.

## You have been defrauded by LionFXM a long time ago?

Collect information about the transactions and make sure you save the advisor’s account details and any other information they have given you.

If you have used a crypto exchange, save the address to which the cryptocurrency was sent. You can usually find this information in your email or on the crypto exchange’s platform. Go to **[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=crypo+terms)** if these terms don’t mean anything to you and you need help, that would go beyond the scope here.

Go to the authorities and give them all the information. They collect this information and bundle it into one big case. **Please do not be ashamed!** The authorities will understand.

## Can’t the authorities do anything – now?

The fraudsters are mostly based in economically weak countries where corruption and money laundering are easy. These include countries like Serbia, Bosnia, Romania, Bulgaria, Albania, Montenegro, Macedonia, Moldova, Ukraine and Georgia. These countries are all known for the fact that money can solve any problem. *Any form of investigation in these countries, especially by local authorities, is obstructed.*

## Did we protect you?
